Annabelle
VISUAL IDENTITY
CHALLENGE
Annabelle is a new-borned wedding planner agency. The mission of the founders is to give to every wedding a strong touch of style and elegance. For this reason, the main idea is to mix tradition and innovation perfectly.

We have applied to Annabelle this concept, making timeless its visual identity, focusing on the attentive choice of soft colours and typography, that could fit with the romantic images and the idea of sweetness.

CORPORATE IDENTITY
Great typography and a minimal and cool color palette.


WEB DESIGN & UI
