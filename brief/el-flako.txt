El Flako
BRAND IDENTITY
CHALLENGE
Being the first. Being the first in showing a new concept in Barcelona. Despite its clear 60’s style. El Flako -the first cereal coffee in Barcelona- is a meeting point to discover the essence of the first cultural revolutions. At El Flako you can relive the real 60’s. So, there is a reason why the Doors’ album Morrison Hotel is the starting point of the coffee’s façade. A clear typography and, in particular, really eye-catching too.

Thanks to El Flako I could experience and create something new. It was a real exercise of style, full of graphic elements adapted to the contemporary line of a urban area, as it is Barcelona. This is what El Flako is: a new style concept.
